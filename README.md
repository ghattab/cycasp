# SEEVIS, (S)egmentation-Fr(EE) (VIS)ualisation

A biomovie is a temporal series of digital microscopy images that is recorded for one selected visual field in a bacterial time course experiment. We present SEEVIS, a data driven (S)egmentation-fr(EE) and automatic pipeline of methods to (VIS)ualise the growth patterns of a cell population conveyed in a biomovie. It consists of three steps 1. signal enhancement to help adjust the signal-to-noise ratio, 2. feature detection so as to draw out qualitative information about the colony development, and 3. the visualisation of the colony in a feature space as a 3D space-time cube supported with three appropriate colour coding methods. These codings are based on two colour palettes (```Tableau10``` and ```Viridis```), are titled and functionally described as follows:

1. Nominal colour coding (NCC) highlights single feature trajectories (```Tableau10```)
2. Time colour coding (TCC) visually promotes the extent of the population growth over time (```Viridis```)
3. Progeny colour coding (PCC) supports the process of tracing back features to their parents (```Tableau10```).

>*SEEVIS colour codings demonstrated for dataset D1. Figure (a) showcases the last frame of the biomovie, as a binary image after signal enhancement. The three colour codings are displayed in the vis: NCC (b), TCC (c), and PCC (d) respectively.*

## Usage

```bash
# Set file permissions
$ chmod +x seevis.py 

# Run SEEVIS on a folder containing all image files 
# Formatted by channel : red, green, blue as c2, c3, c4 respectively for every time point
$ ./seevis.py -i img_directory/

# Or on a CSV file containing feature positions
$ ./seevis.py -f filename.csv -s 2

#  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
#  -i, --input           run SEEVIS on the supplied directory
#  -f, --file            run the Visualisation of SEEVIS
#  -s                    run scheme (or colour coding) ranging from 1 to 4 (default is 1)
